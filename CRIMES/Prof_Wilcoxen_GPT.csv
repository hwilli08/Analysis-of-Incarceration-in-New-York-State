This type of crime can fall under various categories depending on the primary felony being committed by the principal criminal. However, as an offense on its own, ""Criminal Facilitation"" does not fit neatly into any of the specified categories such as violent crimes, sex crimes, or white-collar crimes. Since it involves providing assistance to another person committing a felony without specifying the type of felony, it is challenging to categorize it without additional context.

Therefore, without specific details about the nature of the felony being facilitated, it's difficult to accurately place ""CRIM FACIL 2ND"" within the provided categories. It could potentially involve weapons, drugs, or any other type of felony, but without further information, categorization remains too broad."

291,ATT INTIMI WIT 2ND,na,107,169,"The crime described as ""ATT INTIMI WIT 2ND"" can be interpreted as an attempt to intimidate a witness, second degree. This type of crime is related to obstructing the justice process by attempting to influence or intimidate a witness, usually to deter them from providing testimony in a legal procedure.

This crime could fall under the category of **violence** if it involves threats of physical harm, or under **white-collar crimes** if it relates to the manipulation or coercion in a legal context without the direct use of violence. However, without specific details on whether physical violence or mere psychological or coercive tactics were used, the exact classification can be ambiguous in this summary alone.

Based on common interpretations and the nature of the offense as generally involving coercion or threats to obstruct justice, more likely it falls under:
**white-collar crimes**"

Criminal solicitation typically involves enticing, encouraging, commanding, or otherwise attempting to persuade another person to commit a crime. Depending on the context and the nature of the crime being solicited, it can fall under various categories. However, given the lack of specific details about the type of crime that was solicited, it is not possible to categorize it definitively from the provided information alone. Thus, in this case, we are unable to determine the category because ""Criminal Solicitation"" can range across numerous types of crimes depending on the specific felony that the individual attempted to solicit."

This kind of crime typically involves attempting to coerce or otherwise influence the testimony of a witness. This would generally fall under the category of ""white-collar crimes,"" as it pertains to interference with legal and judicial processes, often seen in the context of manipulating legal outcomes and obstructing justice."
325,CRIM NUISANCE 1,na,105,185,"The crime described as ""CRIM NUISANCE 1"" likely refers to ""Criminal Nuisance in the First Degree."" This crime generally involves knowingly or recklessly creating or maintaining a condition that endangers the safety or health of a considerable number of people. It does not specifically fall squarely into the categories listed such as violent crimes, weapons offenses, drug offenses, burglary and theft, sex crimes, crimes involving children, or white-collar crimes.

However, depending on the nature and circumstances of the nuisance created, it could potentially overlap with drug offenses (if the nuisance pertains to drug activities) or white-collar crimes (if it relates to safety or regulatory violations in a corporate or public setting). Without additional context specifying the nature of the nuisance, it is difficult to definitively categorize ""CRIM NUISANCE 1"" into the provided categories. It typically might be classified more generally under public order offenses."
